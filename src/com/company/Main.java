 ok  what are the 3 classes. I see more

 Shall we create an interface Car

 and street car and off road can inherit

 Ok nice i'm just seeing the changes

 i agree lol
 boolean is easy.

 we can count the isTrue wheels and isFalse for the different tire counts
 does that make sense

/*


I've made 3 classes
let's make the parts first
then we will assemble the car maybe?
yeah interface will be better for car
I've made a basic wheel class

Do we need a name for wheel ? lamo I think we only need the boolean isWide

ughh, are we doing tires as well?
